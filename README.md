### tfsec Issue Explorer

Initial release of the tfsec Issue Explorer. This control will add a new pane to the tool bar showing the current issues in the workspace. 

Note: In this initial release, it is assumed that `tfsec` is on your path and that you have a relatively new version. The command is run in a terminal so any issues will be displayed and you can raise an issue accordingly.
